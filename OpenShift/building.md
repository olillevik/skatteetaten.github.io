The following diagram show the flow from a developer commits and pushes code to git until the DockerImage has been built and pushed to the Docker registry.

TODO: I am staring to wonder if these links and this information is interesting at all. Can we just wait with the details until we opensource it? I feel that Versioning is important to mention though. Since it is not clear in the diagram above. I guess mentioning how Jenkins is set up is also relevant.


Do you want to know more?
 * [jenkins](jenkins.html) for the details on how we build
 * [architect](architect.html)  for details on how the DockerImage is made 
 * [versioning](versioning.html) for details on how we version DockerImages and what tags we tag them with
